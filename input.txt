Behold, an extremely complicated formula:

We have the following equality:

<<F(0) (log absolutevalue(d sub k) - n(gamma + log 8pi) - r sub 1 * pi/2)>>

<< = Sum of the set rho: Phi(rho) - Phi(0) - Phi(1) + 2 * Sum from j=1 to infinity of: Sum of the set German Fraktur P: A fraction (log(N * German Fraktur P) / (N * German Fraktur P)^j/2) * F(j log(N * German Fraktur P))>>

<<-rsub1 integral from 0 to infinity of: fraction(F(0)- F(x) / 2cosh(x/2))dx - n integral from 0 to infinity of: fraction(F(0) - F(x) / 2sinh(x / 2))dx>>,

<<Italics: Where rho runs over the zeros of the Dedekind zeta function of K and German Fraktur P runs over the prime ideals of K.>>
